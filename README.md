# E-Commerse

It is an e-commerce website where people can find products from different seller and can order them to their doorstep. Also they can Wishlist them for future as well. The website accepts payment mode via UPI COD and cards as well with secure payment process. I have created this website using HTML AND CSS.


Highlights of My project : 
Imagine a large shopping mall, where people can find products from different stores all in one place. My e-commerce website is like a virtual version of this shopping mall. Customers can browse and purchase products from different sellers on your website, and have them delivered to their doorstep.

Customers can also save products that they are interested in buying for later by adding them to their wishlist. This is like putting a product on hold at a store. When the customer is ready to buy the product, they can simply remove it from their wishlist and add it to their cart.

My website accepts a variety of payment methods, including UPI, COD, and cards. This makes it easy for customers to pay for their orders in a way that is convenient for them.
